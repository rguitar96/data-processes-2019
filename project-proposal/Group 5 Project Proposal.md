# Group 5 Project Proposal 

**_Why are you interested in this field/domain? Describes in at least 2 - 3 sentences why the
group is interested in this area. May be personal, or related to pertinence of the domain. (1
point)_**

For our project we will use data from the domain of healthcare. We have chosen this topic as it is becoming one of the largest global markets for [data use](https://healthitanalytics.com/news/big-data-analytics-to-bring-billions-in-healthcare-market-growth). From [telehealth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikemontgomery/2016/10/26/the-future-of-health-care-is-in-data-analytics/#7d567b103ee2), the use of devices to track a patieints health remotly, to using AI to [help diagnose and treat patients](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/10/31/does-ai-know-more-than-your-doctor/#773bdefb6357) there are wide range of uses. Many of the uses are not only able to reduce costs for health care providers but allow them to treat those under their care more effectively through targeted care. For our project we would will continue this by focusing on data that allows for comparision of death rates of diseases in different countries and the effect of ecomic factors on the findings. These results could be used to focus care of issues that have a greater effect on death reates (e.g. alchol) and highlight how fincancial resources could be used more effectively.


## Example projects

**_Three examples of other data driven projects related to this domain (6 points, 2 points each)?_**
**_Provides link to a data driven projects (1 point)_**
**_Briefly describes the project in 1 - 2 sentences (1 points)_**
#### European Health Data & Evidence Network (EHDEN)
EHDENâ€™s mission is to reduce the time to provide an answer in real world, health research. It will achieve this by developing the required infrastructure in a federated network at scale across Europe, collaboration on research methodologies, and education in an open science collaboration. [Link to the project.](https://www.ehden.eu/)
#### Fair4Health
Fair4Health is a solution to the European Commission challenge to make the data comply to be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). The objective of Fair4Health is to facilitate and encourage the EU health research community to FAIRify, share and reuse their datasets derived from publicly funded research initiatives.

## Questions
**_Three data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (6 points, 2 points each)_**
**_Question is related to the field (1 point)_**
**_Question can be answered with data (1 point)_**
***
Question proposal by Rodrigo:
1. What are the main death causes over the years?
	-Which is the primary death cause?
	-Has the trend over the years changed the death causes?

2. What are the differences between the countries?  
	COMPARISON USA vs SCOTLAND
	- Are there any differences on the death causes between countries?
	- Does one of the countries have a clear overall lower death rate? Which trend does each country follow?
	- Which country is safer for violent deaths? And for non-violent?

3. Have the lifestyle, economical and social factors involved an influence?  
	USA
	- Are there particular states with much likely causes?
	- Is there a relationship between the rate of not insuranced (USA-no-insurance-group) and death rate by state?
	- Are minority groups (USA-death-rate-race) more exposed to violent deaths? And non-violent?
	
	ECONOMICS
	- How much does the country spend in Public Healthcare VS it's GDP (does this affect specially one death cause more than the other?)
	- Is there a relationship between health expenditure and death rates(USA-gdp-expenditures)?
	
	LIFESTYLE
	- Relationship between cholesterol/hypertension/smoking/weight and corresponding deaths between countries?
